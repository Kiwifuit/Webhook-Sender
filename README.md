# Webhook Sender

Webhook Sender allows you to send messages with a webhook on a discord server

# How to use

First, you'll need:

- This app
- A webhook

If you did not create a webhook, you can create one if you have admin permissions by going to Server Settings > Integration > Webhook > New Webhook

<!-- ======= -->
 If you have a webhook, click on said webhook and click on `Copy Webhook URL`. After that, you are ready to use the program so head to releases and [download the latest version of this app](https://github.com/Kiwifuit/Webhook-Sender/releases/).

 So, you have noticed that there are multiple releases of the same program, here's what they do

<!-- Yay! I found a way to turn it into pure Mâ†“ -->

- sender.exe: Send multiple messages with one webhook
- spammer.exe: Spam/Nuke a server channel with one message and one webhook

So yeah. That's pretty much all for now. I'm planning to a couple things like:

- GUI Versions of every single program here
- An embed sender (GUI)

And maybe more. Thank you for reading this GitHub repo and have a nice day
