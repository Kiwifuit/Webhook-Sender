# Webhook Sender
 Send webhook messages to your discord servers
#
Hello, and thank you for reading this

Webhook Sender allows you to send messages with a webhook on a discord server

# How to use
 First, you'll need:
 - A webhook
 - This app

If you did not create a webhook, you can create one if you have admin permissions by going to Server Settings > Integration > Webhook > New Webhook

 If you have a webhook, click on said webhook and click on `Copy Webhook URL`. After that, you are ready to use the program so head to releases and [download the latest version of this app](https://github.com/Kiwifuit/Webhook-Sender/releases/).

 You enter the link of the webhook you copied earlier, write a message for people to see, and then hit Enter
# Editions of this program or smthn idk
 So, you have noticed that there are multiple releases of the same program, here's what they do
 <!-- Why is this in html? -->
 <ul>
    <li>Sender.exe</li>
    <p>Send multiple messages with one webhook</p>
    <li>Spammer.exe</li>
    <p>Spam/Nuke a server channel with one message and one webhook</li>
</ul>
So yeah. That's pretty much all for now. I'm planning to a couple things like:

- GUI Versions of every single program here
- An embed sender (GUI)

And maybe more. Thank you for reading this GitHub repo and have a nice day
